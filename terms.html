                </ul>
                <p>Content on the App is the responsibility of the provider. This means that you are responsible for Your Content, members are responsible for Member Content, and Down is responsible for Our Content. Down takes no responsibility for the actions of any users.</p>

                <h3>Your Content</h3>
                <p>By uploading images, text, or other content ("Your Content") to our platform, you represent and warrant that you either own all intellectual property rights associated with Your Content or have obtained the necessary permissions from the rights holder to share Your Content on our platform. As such, you agree to fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Down from any claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from the sharing of Your Content in violation of applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
                <p>Importantly, you represent and agree that no images, text, or other content you upload violates any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties, or infringes upon another individual's rights of privacy or publicity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that you will not upload nudity or sexually explicit content to our platform.</p>

                <h3>Member Content</h3>
